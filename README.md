## What is FocoFlow?

FocoFlow is an ML-powered productivity system that **predicts** when you're about to lose focus and **intervenes proactively** before distractions happen.

Traditional productivity trackers are reactive—they tell you what happened *after* you've lost focus. FocoFlow is **predictive**—it learns your behavioral patterns and blocks distractions 30 seconds before you'd naturally context-switch.

### Key Features

- **Sub-millisecond event capture** - C++ engine processes 10,000+ events/second
- **Real-time ML predictions** - LSTM model forecasts focus degradation
- **Adaptive interventions** - Proactive blocking based on your patterns
- **Privacy-first** - All data stays local, no cloud transmission
- **Full-stack dashboard** - Real-time focus score, predictions, analytics

## Architecture

```
C++ Event Engine (Win32) → Python ML Service → Spring Boot API → React Dashboard
    <1ms latency           10ms inference      REST + WebSocket    Real-time UI
```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler:** MSVC 2022 or GCC 11+
- **Python:** 3.10+
- **Java:** JDK 17+
- **Node.js:** 18+
- **PostgreSQL:** 14+

### Setup (Coming Soon)

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-focus.git
cd neural-focus

# Build C++ engine
cd core && mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make

# Set up Python environment
cd ../../ml
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Optional: install xgboost to enable the XGBoost training backend
pip install xgboost

# Start backend
cd ../backend
chmod +x mvnw  # macOS/Linux only (first time)
./mvnw spring-boot:run  # or mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run on Windows

# Start frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install && npm run dev
```

### Local demo helpers

```powershell
# Start backend + inference bridge + frontend (PowerShell)
.\tools\start_neural_focus.ps1

# Cross-platform launcher (Python)
python .\tools\start_neural_focus.py

# Build the core engine (PowerShell)
.\tools\build_core.ps1

# Start the C++ engine (requires ZeroMQ headers/libs and a built exe)
.\core\build\bin\neurofocus_engine.exe --log-dir . --log-base events

# Start stack + replay a recorded log into ZeroMQ (PowerShell)
.\tools\start_neural_focus.ps1 -LogPath .\events_test_2026-01-02.log -ReplaySleepMs 5

# Run just the inference bridge (manual)
python -m ml.inference_server --backend-url http://localhost:8080 --session-goal "Deep work demo"

# Replay a recorded log into ZeroMQ (for demos)
python -m ml.event_replay --log-path .\events_test_2026-01-02.log --endpoint tcp://127.0.0.1:5560
```

### Demo flow (log replay)

1. Start the backend:
   - `mvn spring-boot:run` (in `backend`)
   - Or: `docker compose up -d backend`
2. Run the stack with log replay:
   - `.\tools\start_neural_focus.ps1 -SessionGoal "Deep work demo" -LogPath .\events_test_2026-01-02.log -ReplaySleepMs 5`
3. Open the UI at `http://localhost:5173` and confirm the Live Prediction card updates and the history list fills.

### Docker demo (one command)

```powershell
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.demo.yml up -d --build
```

This starts the backend, frontend, inference bridge, and replay publisher together.

### Docker backend (optional)

```powershell
# Start the Spring Boot API without local Maven
docker compose up -d backend
```

### Metrics & Benchmarks

```powershell
# Summarize a recorded log and feature throughput
python -m ml.metrics_report --log-path .\events_test_2026-01-02.log --benchmark-features
```

See `docs/METRICS.md` for a sample report.
See `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` for Docker-based deployment instructions.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1.  **Backend fails to start:**
    *   Ensure Java 17+ is installed (`java -version`).
    *   Ensure Maven is installed (`mvn -version`) or use the Docker method.
    *   If using Docker, ensure Docker Desktop is running (`docker info`).

2.  **Port Conflicts:**
    *   **8080 (Backend):** If occupied, change `server.port` in `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`.
    *   **5173 (Frontend):** Vite will automatically switch to 5174+ if 5173 is busy.
    *   **5560 (ZeroMQ):** Ensure no other instance of the engine or replay script is running.

3.  **Missing Log File:**
    *   If `events_test_2026-01-02.log` is missing, generate a dummy one:
        ```bash
        python generate_log.py
        ```

4.  **UI Not Updating:**
    *   Check if the backend is running (`http://localhost:8080/actuator/health`).
    *   Check if the inference server is running (check terminal logs).
    *   Ensure the replay script is actually sending events (check for "Published event" logs).
